# Pyramid of Success Assessment

Diagnose what's missing in a person's or team's foundation for success by assessing each building block of John Wooden's Pyramid of Success.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Why am I not succeeding?" or "What's holding me back?"
- Someone is working hard but not seeing results
- A team or organization seems stuck despite effort
- Request for "Assess my Pyramid of Success"
- Diagnosing why goals aren't materializing

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Current situation, goals, and what success would look like |
| efforts | Yes | What has been tried, recent actions taken |
| obstacles | No | What seems to be blocking progress |
| context | No | Personal, team, or organizational context |

## The Pyramid Framework

### Level 1: Foundation (Cornerstones)

| Block | Question | Signs of Weakness |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Industriousness** | Is there genuine hard work, not just activity? | Shortcuts, inconsistent effort, "working smart" as excuse for not working hard |
| **Friendship** | Are genuine relationships being built? | Isolation, transactional relationships, no support network |
| **Loyalty** | Is there faithfulness to self and commitments? | Breaking promises, shifting blame, self-betrayal |
| **Cooperation** | Is there willingness to work with others? | "My way" thinking, poor listening, ego over team |
| **Enthusiasm** | Is there genuine love for the work? | Going through motions, dread, no energy |

**Wooden's insight:** "Industriousness and Enthusiasm are the cornerstones. Without hard work and love for what you do, nothing else matters."

### Level 2: Building Blocks

| Block | Question | Signs of Weakness |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Self-Control** | Are emotions and impulses managed? | Reactive decisions, emotional peaks and valleys, lack of discipline |
| **Alertness** | Is there awareness and openness to learning? | Missing opportunities, closed-minded, not noticing what's happening |
| **Initiative** | Is action taken when needed? | Waiting for permission, fear of failure, paralysis |
| **Intentness** | Is focus maintained despite distractions? | Shiny object syndrome, giving up too early, rabbit trails |

### Level 3: Heart of the Pyramid

| Block | Question | Signs of Weakness |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Condition** | Is there physical, mental, and moral fitness? | Exhaustion, mental fog, moral compromise |
| **Skill** | Are fundamentals mastered? | Skipping basics, sloppy execution, no practice routine |
| **Team Spirit** | Is there willingness to sacrifice for the group? | Self-promotion, credit-seeking, undermining others |

### Level 4: Upper Structure

| Block | Question | Signs of Weakness |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Poise** | Is there comfort with oneself? | Trying to be someone else, anxiety about image, fighting yourself |
| **Confidence** | Is there earned belief based on preparation? | False bravado, unpreparedness disguised as confidence, or crippling doubt |

### Level 5: Apex

| Block | Question | Signs of Weakness |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Competitive Greatness** | Is best performance available when it's most needed? | Choking under pressure, avoiding challenges, no joy in difficult situations |

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Foundation Check
Start at the bottom. If cornerstones are weak, nothing above them matters.
- Is Industriousness present? (Real hard work, not just busyness)
- Is Enthusiasm present? (Genuine love for the work)

**If either cornerstone is missing, stop here. The foundation must be fixed first.**

### Step 2: Level-by-Level Ascent
Move up only when each level is solid:
- Check each block at the current level
- Identify specific evidence of strength or weakness
- Note which blocks need attention before proceeding

### Step 3: Pattern Recognition
Look for patterns across blocks:
- Multiple blocks in same category suggest systemic issue
- Weakness at lower levels explains failures at higher levels
- Isolated weakness at high level suggests targeted development need

### Step 4: Root Cause Identification
Trace symptoms back to root causes:
- Performance anxiety often traces to weak Condition or Confidence
- Inconsistent results often trace to weak Self-Control or Intentness
- Team dysfunction often traces to weak Cooperation or Team Spirit

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Pyramid of Success Assessment

### Situation Summary
[Brief restatement of goals and current state]

### Foundation Diagnosis

#### Cornerstones
| Block | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Industriousness | [Strong/Weak/Missing] | [Specific observations] |
| Enthusiasm | [Strong/Weak/Missing] | [Specific observations] |

#### Supporting Foundation
| Block | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Friendship | ... | ... |
| Loyalty | ... | ... |
| Cooperation | ... | ... |

### Critical Gap Identified
**Primary weakness:** [The most important missing block]
**Why this matters:** [How this gap connects to current struggles]
**Root cause:** [What's underneath the weakness]

### Wooden's Prescription

**Immediate focus:** [One specific block to strengthen first]

**Specific actions:**
1. [Concrete action tied to the weak block]
2. [Practice or habit to build]
3. [Daily discipline to implement]

**What to stop doing:** [Activity or mindset that's undermining the foundation]

### The Path Forward
[Brief summary of how strengthening this foundation will support the higher levels and ultimately produce success]

*"Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable."*
```

## Constraints

- Always start assessment at the foundation, never the apex
- Do not skip levels; diagnosis must be systematic
- Focus on effort and character, never outcomes or comparisons to others
- Provide concrete, actionable recommendations
- Use Wooden's voice: patient, principled, teaching-focused

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I've been working on my startup for two years. We have a good product but can't seem to grow. I work 12-hour days but feel like we're spinning our wheels."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Pyramid of Success Assessment

### Situation Summary
A startup founder is working extremely hard but not seeing growth despite having a good product. The symptom is stagnation; we need to find which block of the Pyramid is weak.

### Foundation Diagnosis

#### Cornerstones
| Block | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Industriousness | Strong | 12-hour days, sustained effort over two years |
| Enthusiasm | Uncertain | "Spinning wheels" suggests possible burnout or loss of joy |

#### Supporting Foundation
| Block | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Friendship | Weak | No mention of relationships, support network, or team connection |
| Loyalty | Strong | Two years of commitment despite difficulty |
| Cooperation | Unknown | Need more information about team dynamics |

### Critical Gap Identified

**Primary weakness:** The combination of strong Industriousness with "spinning wheels" suggests the problem is not effort but direction. This points to weak **Alertness**—the block about being observant, open-minded, and eager to learn.

**Why this matters:** When we work hard but don't see results, we often work harder at the same things. Alertness means paying attention to what the market, customers, and results are telling us. Without it, Industriousness becomes "activity mistaken for achievement."

**Root cause:** High effort may be creating tunnel vision. The focus on "doing more" prevents "seeing differently."

### Wooden's Prescription

**Immediate focus:** Alertness

**Specific actions:**
1. Spend one day this week doing nothing but listening—to customers, to team members, to competitors. Take notes without responding.
2. Ask five customers: "What would make you recommend us to a friend?" Listen to the actual words they use.
3. Each morning this week, before working, write down: "What am I not seeing?"

**What to stop doing:** Stop measuring success by hours worked. Start measuring by what you learned.

### The Path Forward

Hard work without awareness is like running fast in the wrong direction. Once Alertness is strengthened, your Industriousness will be channeled effectively. The product may be good—but Alertness will reveal whether it's good at solving the right problem for the right people.

*"Never mistake activity for achievement."*
